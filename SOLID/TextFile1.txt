Cohesion --
1. If class has memebers having relationship with there class methods / fields  it can be kept in 1 class highly cohesive
property or feild which has very less relationship or dependent / used can be kept in another class (High cohisive is good)

2. If we seprate Entites which are less dependent on each other into another class then it has loose coupling (loose coupling is good).

3 . If details are added tommorow of less dependent enities then if they are clubed into same class it becomes difficult so separation of class is good that loose
coupling new details can be added easily
